# Snake Game

## Overview
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The objective of the game 
is to control the snake, eat the food, and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
On collision, the game records highest scores for future games and resets the game. 

## Features
- Classic snake movement
- Food spawning at random locations
- Score tracking with a scoreboard
- High score detection
- Game-over detection

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6 or later).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Install necessary dependencies (if any). The game uses the built-in `turtle` module, which comes with Python.

## How to Run
Run the main script to start the game:
```sh
python main.py
```

## File Structure
- `main.py` - Handles game initialization and main game loop
- `snake.py` - Defines the snake's behavior and movement
- `food.py` - Manages food spawning
- `scoreboard.py` - Keeps track of the score and displays it

## Controls
- Arrow keys: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
